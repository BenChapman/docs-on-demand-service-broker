If developers report errors such as:

<pre class="terminal">
Server error, status code: 502, error code: 10001, message: Service broker error: instance does not exist`
</pre>

1. Run `cf service MY-INSTANCE --guid` to check that the service instance exists in BOSH and CF.

1. Pre-pend the text `service_instance-` to the GUID you just obtained to create the ID that BOSH uses for your service instance (e.g. if your GUID is `1Hy6H`, this becomes `service_instance-1Hy6H`).

1. Run `bosh vms INSTANCE-GUID` with the service instance ID from the last step.

If the bosh deployment is not found then it has been deleted from BOSH. Contact Pivotal support for further assistance on recovery.
