This guide is intended for people who want to author service tiles for PCF using the on-demand service broker SDK.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Pivotal Cloud Foundry operators make software services such as databases available to developers by using the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard** to install service tiles. Before Bosh 2.0, operators configured a service tile by pre-assigning a block of VMs with fixed CPU, hard disk, and RAM levels to allocate as instances for each service. This limited the possible number of instances and demanded wasteful one-size-fits-all resource provisioning.

On-demand services let you provision instances more flexibly. The operator does not pre-allocate a block of VMs for the instance pool. Instead, they can specify an allowable range rather than fixed settings for instance resource levels. When a developer creates an on-demand service instance, they then provision it at creation time.

The on-demand service broker SDK makes it easy to create PCF tiles for on-demand services. Whether you're an in Independent Software Vendor (ISV) plugging into the growing PCF community or an internal development team at Pivotal, the on-demand service broker offers an easy way to create a dynamically-provisionable service tile.

The [About the On-Demand Service Broker SDK](./about.html) topic describes in greater detail how the on-demand service broker SDK works.
