# <a id="release-notes"></a>v0.15.0-alpha-1 Release Notes

## <a id="minimum-version-requirements"></a>Minimum Version Requirements

- BOSH 257+ / BOSH lite v9000.131.0
- CF 238+

## <a id="new-features"></a>New Features

- Operator can turn on application developer triggered upgrades.
  - To enable set ODB manifest flag `features.cf_user_triggered_upgrades` to `true` - default is to false.
  - Operators can make any change to the service plan (stemcell, releases, properties) and the ODB will detect a `pending-change`
  - ODB only detects manifest changes, not Cloud Config or Runtime Config changes.
  - Once a pending change has been detected the cf cli user will need to trigger the change by passing the `apply-changes: true` paramater.
  - When the feature is disabled, application developers will not be able to make changes to service instances with pending changes until the operator runs the `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand.
- For create/update/delete operations that fail, the cf user will now be presented with a detailed error messagee that includes: odb-request-id, service-name, service-instance-guid, bosh-task-id, operator-type. 
  - This should allow for quicker debugging interactions between the app developer and the operator

# <a id="known-issues"></a>Known Issues

On PCF for GCP deployments, Ops Manager service network VMs are not assigned the correct firewall rules. As a result, these VMs cannot communicate with the BOSH Director and service tiles that use the On-Demand Service Broker (ODB) fail to create service instances.

As a workaround, if you are deploying a service network in GCP, modify your firewall to use subnet CIDR-based rules.
