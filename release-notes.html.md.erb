On PCF for GCP deployments, Ops Manager service network VMs are not assigned the correct firewall rules. As a result, these VMs cannot communicate with the BOSH Director and service tiles that use the On-Demand Service Broker (ODB) fail to create service instances.

As a workaround, if you are deploying a service network in GCP, modify your firewall to use subnet CIDR-based rules.
